## Project Summary

- **Objective:** Predict customer happiness based on the answers provided in survey responses.
- **Approach:** Built and evaluated multiple machine learning models including SVMs and ensemble tree-based classifiers.
- **Outcome:** Achieved robust performance with interpretable results; the best accuracy reached 76.9% using a minimal feature set.
- **Recommendation:** Highlight the key predictive features and propose new questions to maximize the value of customer feedback.

## Project Workflow

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
[Dataset](./ACME-HappinessSurvey2020.csv) 

- Assessed class balance, feature distributions, and potential correlations.
- Calculate the Mutual Information and Chi-Squared scores indentifing the more predictive or informative features for the possitive prediction.

### 2. Feature Engineering
- Created and tested a large group of new features, including:
- Weighted sum for the strongest contributors: `X_1_5_6_weighted`
- Binary indicators: e.g., `X1_is_5`, `X6_is_5`
- Binary flags: e.g., `X2_dissappointed`, `X4_bad_price`
- Aggregated features such as `X_avg_all` and `num_fives`.

### 3. Model Training
- Compared multiple classifiers (27 models): **NuSVC**, **ExtraTreesClassifier**, **RandomForestClassifier**, and more using the Lazypredict library.
- Experiment with hyperparameters optimization and evaluated performance through cross-validation accuracy.

### 4. Evaluation Strategy
- Performed exhaustive feature selection considering Mutual Information and Chi-Square Scores, and also Partial Dependence on Prediction.
- Measured accuracy over a fixed train/test split using all the combinations between the best 6 performing models with all the possible groups of features between a sub-selection of 4 to 10 features from the intermediary 12 feature selection. This *brute-force* approach has been chossen because the dataset was limited and the training time was very quick.
- Using cross-validations accuracy over 5 stratified folds, measured average accuracy and variance to ensure model robustness, where we evaluate the performance of the 14 best performing pair of models and group of selected features.
- Identified top-performing combinations with highest predictive power.

### 5. Insights
- Found that models with fewer well-engineered features performed comparably to those using the full set.
- ExtraTreesClassifier and RandomForestClassifier offered the best trade-off between performance and consistency.

### 6. Key Results

### 7. Study Conclusion and Recommendation (Condensed Version)

This study aimed not only to predict customer satisfaction based on survey data but also to identify the most informative questions for future surveys. Through feature engineering and robust evaluation (including recall on the negative class), we confirmed that:

- A minimal set of six features performed best, particularly with ExtraTreesClassifier and RandomForestClassifier.
- When optimizing for recall on dissatisfied customers, the same configurations were most effective.
- Three core questions consistently drove satisfaction predictions: delivery timeliness (X1), completeness of the order (X3), and app usability (X6).

To enhance future survey design:

- **Retain** X1, X3, and X6 as essential questions.
- **Remove** less informative items (e.g., X2, X4, X5).
- **Add** new 2 proposed questions on communication and packaging quality.
- **Include** a classification question asking customers to identify the main driver behind their satisfaction.

This refined survey approach boosts insight quality while reducing cognitive load, helping businesses act swiftly on dissatisfaction signals and improve customer retention.
